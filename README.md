# About the project

This page is done by a student from I.E.S El Rincon. It's a fan made Website of F1(Fomula 1). Inside there is 3 pages, Home/Inicio, Circuitos/Tracks and Contactos/Contacts. Each one it's self explanatory. It's my first project with the framework React.
Kudos to Tiburcio Cruz Ravelo for teaching us this framework.
